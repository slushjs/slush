> The streaming scaffolding system - Gulp as a replacement for Yeoman

## Use Gulp instead of Yeoman

Slush is a tool to be able to use Gulp for project scaffolding.

Slush does not contain anything "out of the box", except the ability to locate installed slush generators
and to run them with [`liftoff`](https://www.npmjs.org/package/liftoff).

To be able to provide functionality like Yeoman, see: [Yeoman like behavior](#yeoman-like-behavior) below.

## Install

Install `slush` globally with:

```bash
npm install -g slush
```

## Usage

```bash
slush <generator>[:<tasks>] [<args>]
```

* `<tasks>`: a colon (":") separated list of a task or tasks to run. If not provided the `default` task in the slushfile is run
* `<args>`: any other given arguments (not prefixed with "--" or "-") can be accessed via the `gulp.args` property from within a slushfile

**Example:**

```bash
slush angular:component myNewComponent
```

Which will run task `component` in generator `slush-angular` and `gulp.args` will be set to `["myNewComponent"]`.

### List available generators

If run without any arguments, slush will list all installed generators.

```bash
slush
```

### List available tasks in generator

To list available tasks within a generator, use the generator name in conjunction with the `--tasks` parameter.

```bash
slush <generator> --tasks
```

### Print version(s)

As usual you can use `-v` or `--version` to get the current slush version:

```bash
slush -v
```

It can also be used together with a generator name:

```bash
slush <generator> -v
```

You'll then get the version for slush, the gulp version installed in the generator and the version number of the given generator.

## Creating a generator

A Slush generator is an npm package following the naming convention `slush-*` and containing a `slushfile.js`.

Add `slushgenerator` as a keyword in your `package.json`.

As when building gulp plugins all slush generators need to have `gulp` installed as a local dependency.

All `slush-*` packages should be installed globally (for now) to be found by the slush executable.

**Note** remember to add gulp plugins (and gulp itself) as ordinary dependencies, instead of devDependencies, when building a slush generator.


## Documentation

### Things to remember

* Install `slush` globally
* Install slush generators globally
* When creating slush generators:
   - name them `slush-<name>`
   - add `slushgenerator` as package keyword
   - create a slushfile.js
   - Install `gulp` and used gulp plugins for your generator as ordinary dependencies
* You can test your slush generator by running `slush .` in your slush generator's directory.

### Slush uses gulp

Slush is just the global excutable to trigger slush generators, under the hood it's still gulp that is run using each slushfile as config file.

### The slushfile

A slushfile is basically a gulpfile, but meant to be used to scaffold project structures.

#### Why not name it "gulpfile" then?

Because a Slush generator may want to use gulp locally for linting, testing and other purposes, in which case it will need to have a gulpfile.

#### Sample slushfile

Given a slush generator project structure with a web app project template inside `./templates/app/`, a slushfile could be designed like this:

```javascript
var gulp = require('gulp'),
    install = require('gulp-install'),
    conflict = require('gulp-conflict'),
    template = require('gulp-template'),
    inquirer = require('inquirer');

gulp.task('default', function (done) {
  inquirer.prompt([
    {type: 'input', name: 'name', message: 'Give your app a name', default: gulp.args.join(' ')}, // Get app name from arguments by default
    {type: 'confirm', name: 'moveon', message: 'Continue?'}
  ],
  function (answers) {
    if (!answers.moveon) {
      return done();
    }
    gulp.src(__dirname + '/templates/app/**')  // Note use of __dirname to be relative to generator
      .pipe(template(answers))                 // Lodash template support
      .pipe(conflict('./'))                    // Confirms overwrites on file conflicts
      .pipe(gulp.dest('./'))                   // Without __dirname here = relative to cwd
      .pipe(install())                         // Run `bower install` and/or `npm install` if necessary
      .on('end', function () {
        done();                                // Finished!
      })
      .resume();
  });
});
```

## Yeoman like behavior

Use these packages/plugins:

- [inquirer](https://github.com/SBoudrias/Inquirer.js) - To prompt the user for input
- [gulp-install](https://github.com/slushjs/gulp-install) - To install npm and bower packages after scaffolding
- [gulp-conflict](https://github.com/slushjs/gulp-conflict) - To prompt before overwriting files on regeneration
